# LOUDER-challenge
LOUDER challenge in cyber talents of Morse code lesson

after I have downloaded the file with command 'wget'
--> wget https://hubchallenges.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Crypto/morse.wav
# Firstly:
I tried this command -->
 cat morse.wav | strings | grep -i flag{ <br>
to see if there is a string of the flag format inside the file but founc nothing
# Secondly:
I tried <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/rtpmixsound/">rtpmixsound</a> tool
as follows:
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/HhwpYV1/rtpmixsound-v.png" alt="rtpmixsound-v" border="0"></a><br /><br />
# Thirdly:
I tried audacity tool, I pressed on file and opened morse.wav file
<a href="https://ibb.co/djG5fPQ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9csrpbq/audacity.png" alt="audacity" border="0"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://imgbb.com/'>share image</a><br />
then because of our old knowledge in morse code it is only (-) and (.)
so I wrote them based on the visual view of the waves like that ->
<a href="https://ibb.co/z6b3660"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qJ9HJJP/pic1.jpg" alt="pic1" border="0"></a><br /><br />
# The End:
I copied the info and pasted it on online morse decoder ->
<a href="https://ibb.co/Qd5rRFc"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cLmDHcv/pic2.jpg" alt="pic2" border="0"></a><br /><br />

# Friendly advice:
Don't cheat the flag without fighting.
